They are installed into an existing or predrilled, pre-taped hole and are fully threaded. Measurements are made from the underside of the head to the tip of the screw to obtain fastener length. If nuts are needed, use with nuts of the same material, finish, and threading for proper fit.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information5-piece per bagSteel constructionZinc-plated#10-32 x 1-1/2 in.Round head combination driveFine threadingFine threadingNote: Product may vary by store  \n",
